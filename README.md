# MRI Super-Resolution

This project follows the GAN approach described in [Github/Tensor Layer/SRGAN](https://github.com/tensorlayer/srgan.git). We process low-resolution and high-resolution versions of MRI dicom images through the SRGAN architecture to perform super-resolution with the goal to speed up MRI by taking quicker, lower resolution scans of the patient.
