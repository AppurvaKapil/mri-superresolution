# MRI Super-Resolution

This project makes use of the repository [Github/Tensor Layer/SRGAN](https://github.com/tensorlayer/srgan.git), which is an implementation of the paper, [Photo-Realistic Single Image Super-Resolution Using a Generative Adversarial Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04802). We process low-resolution and high-resolution versions of MRI dicom images through the SRGAN architecture to perform super-resolution with the goal to speed up MRI by taking quicker, lower resolution scans of the patient.
